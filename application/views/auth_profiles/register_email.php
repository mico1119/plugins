Someone (possibly you) has registered for a login named "<?=$login_name?>".  If you are that someone, follow this link to verify your email address and complete the process:

<?= 
url::site('verifyemail') . '?' . http_build_query(array(
    'email_verification_token' => $email_verification_token
))
?>
